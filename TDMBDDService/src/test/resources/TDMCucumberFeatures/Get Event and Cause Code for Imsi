Feature: Get Event and Cause Code per Imsi
   Display / Generate, for a given affected IMSI, the Event ID and Cause Code for any / all failures affecting that IMSI	

# Considering only valid events here - data validation tested elsewhere


Background:
# Only required data fields included here, other are not needed / tested, so can be generated
# as dummy data in the test steps, but the data needs to be valid to be imported - 
# Full event list
#Event Id	Failure Class	UE Type	Market	Operator	Cell Id	Duration	Cause Code	NE Version	IMSI	HIER3_ID	HIER32_ID	HIER321_ID
 
	Given the following event data
  |  IMSI     		  | event_id | Cause code    |
  |  344930000000011  |     4097 |           0   |
  |  344930000000011  |     4097 |           1   |
  |  344930000000011  |     4098 |           3   |
  |  240210000000013  |     4125 |          17   |
  |  240210000000013  |     4106 |          11   |
  |  310560000000012  |     4098 |           3   |
 



Scenario Outline: list of eventCauses generated 
	When query all event and cause code data for a hard-coded imsi from before section <imsi>
	Then result should be <result>
	Examples:
  |  IMSI     		  | event_id | Cause code    |
  |  344930000000011  |     4097 |           0   |
  |  344930000000011  |     4097 |           1   |
  |  344930000000011  |     4098 |           3   |
